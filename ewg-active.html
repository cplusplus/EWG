<h1>C++ Standard Evolution Active Issues List (Revision R05)</h1>
<p>Revised 2014-01-16 at 19:01:45 UTC</p>

  <p>Reference ISO/IEC IS 14882:2003(E)</p>
  <p>Also see:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><a href="ewg-toc.html">Table of Contents</a> for all evolution issues.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>The purpose of this document is to record the status of issues
  which have come before the Evolution Working Group (EWG) of the INCITS PL22.16
  and ISO WG21 C++ Standards Committee. Issues represent
  potential defects in the ISO/IEC IS 14882:2003(E) document, 
  and proposed extensions to it.
  </p>

  <p>This document contains only evolution issues which are actively being
  considered by the Evolution Working Group, i.e., issues which have a
  status of <a href="ewg-active.html#New">New</a>, <a href="ewg-active.html#Open">Open</a>, 
  <a href="ewg-active.html#Ready">Ready</a>, or <a href="ewg-active.html#Review">Review</a>. See
  <a href="ewg-complete.html">Evolution Completed Issues List</a> for issues considered completed (adopted) and 
  <a href="ewg-closed.html">Evolution Closed Issues List</a> for issues considered closed (rejected).</p>

  <p>The issues in these lists are not necessarily formal ISO Defect
  Reports (DR's). While some issues will eventually be elevated to
  official Defect Report status, other issues will be disposed of in
  other ways. See <a href="#Status">Issue Status</a>.</p>

  <p>This document includes <i>[bracketed italicized notes]</i> as a
  reminder to the EWG of current progress on issues. Such notes are
  strictly unofficial and should be read with caution as they may be
  incomplete or incorrect. Be aware that EWG support for a particular
  resolution can quickly change if new viewpoints or killer examples are
  presented in subsequent discussions.</p>

  <p>For the most current official version of this document see 
  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/</a>.
  Requests for further information about this document should include
  the document number above, reference ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E), and be
  submitted to Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), 1250 Eye
  Street NW, Washington, DC 20005.</p>

  join the standards committee, submit an issue, or comment on an issue
  can be found in the comp.std.c++ FAQ.

<p><a name="submit_issue"></a><b>How to submit an issue</b></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
<li><a name="submit_issue_A"></a>
Mail your issue to the author of this list.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_B"></a>
Specify a short descriptive title.  If you fail to do so, the subject line of your
mail will be used as the issue title.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_C"></a>
If the "From" on your email is not the name you wish to appear as issue submitter,
then specify issue submitter.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_D"></a>
Provide a brief discussion of the problem you wish to correct.  Refer to the latest
working draft or standard using [section.tag] and paragraph numbers where appropriate.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_E"></a>
Provide proposed wording.  This should indicate exactly how you want the standard
to be changed.  General solution statements belong in the discussion area.  This
area contains very clear and specific directions on how to modify the current
draft.  If you are not sure how to word a solution, you may omit this part.
But your chances of a successful issue greatly increase if you attempt wording.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_F"></a>
It is not necessary for you to use html markup.  However, if you want to, you can
&lt;ins&gt;<ins>insert text like this</ins>&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;<del>delete text like
this</del>&lt;/del&gt;.  The only strict requirement is to communicate clearly to
the list maintainer exactly how you want your issue to look.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_G"></a>
It is not necessary for you to specify other html font/formatting
mark-up, but if you do the list maintainer will attempt to respect your
formatting wishes (as described by html markup, or other common idioms).
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_H"></a>
It is not necessary for you to specify open date or last modified date (the date
of your mail will be used).
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_I"></a>
It is not necessary for you to cross reference other issues, but you can if you
like.  You do not need to form the hyperlinks when you do, the list maintainer will
take care of that.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_J"></a>
One issue per email is best.
</li>
<li><a name="submit_issue_K"></a>
Between the time you submit the issue, and the next mailing deadline
(date at the top of the Revision History), you <em>own</em> this issue. 
You control the content, the stuff that is right, the stuff that is
wrong, the format, the misspellings, etc.  You can even make the issue
disappear if you want.  Just let the list maintainer know how you want
it to look, and he will try his best to accommodate you.  After the
issue appears in an official mailing, you no longer enjoy exclusive
ownership of it.

<h2><a name="Status"></a>Issue Status</h2>

  <p><b><a name="New">New</a></b> - The issue has not yet been
  reviewed by the EWG. Any <b>Wording available</b> is purely a
  suggestion from the issue submitter, and should not be construed as
  the view of EWG.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Open">Open</a></b> - The EWG has discussed the issue
  but is not yet ready to move the issue forward. There are several
  possible reasons for open status:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Consensus may have not yet have been reached as to how to deal
            with the issue.</li>
        <li>Informal consensus may have been reached, but the EWG awaits
            exact resolution for review.</li>
        <li>The EWG wishes to consult additional technical experts before
            proceeding.</li>
        <li>The issue may require further study.</li>
     </ul>

  <p>A <b>Wording available</b> for an open issue is still not be
  construed as the view of EWG. Comments on the current state of
  discussions are often given at the end of open issues in an italic
  font. Such comments are for information only and should not be given
  undue importance.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Deferred">Deferred</a></b> - The EWG has discussed the issue,
  is not yet ready to move the issue forward, but neither does it deem the
  issue significant enough to delay publishing a standard or Technical Report.
  A typical deferred issue would be seeking to clarify wording that might be
  technically correct, but easily mis-read.</p>

  <p>A <b>Wording available</b> for a deferred issue is still not be
  construed as the view of EWG. Comments on the current state of
  discussions are often given at the end of open issues in an italic
  font. Such comments are for information only and should not be given
  undue importance.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Dup">Dup</a></b> - The EWG has reached consensus that
  the issue is a duplicate of another issue, and will not be further
  dealt with. A <b>Rationale</b> identifies the duplicated issue's
  issue number.  </p>

  <p><b><a name="NAD">NAD</a></b> - The EWG has reached consensus that
  the issue is not a defect in the Standard nor is it an extension
  the EWG deems acceptable.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Review">Review</a></b> - Exact resolution is now 
  available for review on an issue for which the EWG previously reached 
  informal consensus.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Ready">Ready</a></b> - The EWG has reached consensus
  that the issue is an extension that can go forward to Core, Library,
  or a Study Group for further processing.</p>

  <p><b><a name="Resolved">Resolved</a></b> - The EWG has reached consensus
  that the issue is a defect in or an acceptable extension to the Standard, 
  but the resolution adopted to
  resolve the issue came via some other mechanism than this issue in the
  list - typically by applying a formal paper, occasionally as a side effect
  of consolidating several interacting issue resolutions into a single issue.</p>

  <p><b><a name="DR">DR</a></b> - (Defect Report) - It's not expected
  that the EWG would handle Defect Reports.</p>

  <p><b><a name="WP">WP</a></b> - (Working Paper) - The proposed
  resolution has not been accepted as a Technical Corrigendum, but
  the full WG21/PL22.16 committee has voted to apply the issue's resolution
  to the working paper.</p>

  <p><b>Tentatively</b> - This is a <i>status qualifier</i>.  The issue has
  been reviewed online, or at an unofficial meeting, but not in an official meeting, and some support has been formed
  for the qualified status.  Tentatively qualified issues may be moved to the unqualified status
  and forwarded to full committee (if Ready) within the same meeting.  Unlike Ready issues, Tentatively Ready issues
  will be reviewed in subcommittee prior to forwarding to full committee.  When a status is
  qualified with Tentatively, the issue is still considered active.</p>

  <p><b>Pending</b> - This is a <i>status qualifier</i>.  When prepended to
  a status this indicates the issue has been
  processed by the committee, and a decision has been made to move the issue to
  the associated unqualified status.  However for logistical reasons the indicated
  outcome of the issue has not yet appeared in the latest working paper.

  <p>Issues are always given the status of <a href="ewg-active.html#New">New</a> when
  they first appear on the issues list. They may progress to
  <a href="ewg-active.html#Open">Open</a> or <a href="ewg-active.html#Review">Review</a> while the EWG
  is actively working on them. When the EWG has reached consensus on
  the disposition of an issue, the status will then change to
  <a href="ewg-active.html#Dup">Dup</a>, <a href="ewg-active.html#NAD">NAD</a>, or
  <a href="ewg-active.html#Ready">Ready</a> as appropriate.  Once the full J16 committee votes to
  forward Ready issues to the Project Editor, they are given the
  status of Defect Report ( <a href="ewg-active.html#DR">DR</a>). These in turn may
  become the basis for Technical Corrigenda (<a href="ewg-active.html#TC1">TC1</a>),
  or are closed without action other than a Record of Response
  (<a href="ewg-active.html#Resolved">Resolved</a> ). The intent of this EWG process is that
  issues which are defects in or accepted extensions to the Standard move to the
  formal ISO DR status.

There are lots of very basic manipulations that are either really hard
or impossible to do with argument packs unless you use something that
causes a big recursive template instantiation, which is expensive at
compile-time and can cause bad error messages.  I want to be able to
index argument packs with integral constant expressions, "take" or
"drop" the first N elements of the pack, etc.

<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
We have a hash function for built-in types and for some standard library types, but we don't have automatically generated hash&lt;&gt; specializations for user-defined types like
<pre>
  struct my_type {
    int x;
    std::string y;
    vector&lt;int&gt; z;
  };
</pre>
Defining a good and efficient hash function for composite types takes a fair amount of work. One consequence is that there are a lot of user-defined types with bad hash functions floating around.

One possibility is automatically generating hash&lt;&gt; specializations, but that's tricky. A simpler possibility is providing tools that make it easier for users to do the right thing.
</p>
<p>
Bristol 2013: Austern explained that he didn't envision syntax to automate the generation of hash operations but thought that this could potentially be solved by a library. Stroustrup and Austern thought that reflection would be another way to solve this. Van Winkel thought that for the generation of such things, it's perhaps desirable that they aren't generated by default but can be generated on demand when a user-defined type requests such generation. The guidance of the EWG is to propose a solution that handles equality operators and other such things in a more general manner.

EWG expressed long-term interest in this idea in Chicago 2013 for post-C++14.

<p>
Sometimes we want to define a variable that's unused except for its
constructor and destructor. lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt; and ScopeGuard are
decent examples of this. In C++11, we have to manually name the
variable something unique. Sometimes we use _some_name_##__LINE__
(suitably wrapped so the concatenation happens after expanding
__LINE__) to try to generate unique names automatically, and gcc/clang
have an extension _some_name_##__COUNTER__
<p>

</p>
to allow multiple such variables on the same line. These are pretty
verbose and not convenient for casual use.

Haskell allows _ (underscore) to stand in for a variable that's not
going to be used. Googlemock defines testing::_ to mean "don't care"
as an argument, which is similar but not identical.
</p>
<p>
Bristol 2013: Stroustrup wondered how unique the name needs to be, and wondered whether parallel builds would have problems ensuring the uniqueness. Naumann pointed out that having an unnamed variable is useful also for cases where you don't want the variable's address to be taken etc. Stroustrup and Van Winkel said this is not tiny, and a proper paper is necessary for this issue. 
</p>
<p>
Chicago 2013: Deemed not as C++14 material, Yasskin or someone else
invited to write a paper, straw polls in favor of the feature. Things
to consider in the paper: Consider double underscore "__". Can 
it be used only in local scope? For class members? For globals?

I had submitted a DR (727) about this in October 2008 - and it was
classified as an extension - I wonder if Spertus' DR (1077) that was
also classified as an extension should be considered along with this
one.


14.7.3 [temp.expl.spec] paragraph 2 requires that explicit
specializations of member templates be declared in namespace scope,
not in the class definition. This restriction does not apply to
partial specializations of member templates; that is,
<pre>
    struct A {
      template&lt;class T&gt; struct B;
      template &lt;class T&gt; struct B&lt;T*&gt; { }; // well-formed
      template &lt;&gt; struct B&lt;int*&gt; { }; // ill-formed
    };
</pre>
There does not seem to be a good reason for this inconsistency.
</p>
<p>
Bristol 2013: Defer to Core, with the guidance to reopen the DR mentioned and remove the restriction. 
</p>
<p>
Before this can go over to Core, it needs wording. It's likely that it
needs a paper. Vali should create either the wording or the paper.

In n3485 21.4.2p6 (basic_string constructors and assignment operators), we have:

<pre>
  basic_string(const charT* s, size_type n,
  const Allocator&amp; a = Allocator());
  Requires: s shall not be a null pointer and n &lt; npos.
</pre>


That requires clause is too restrictive; s can be a null pointer when n==0.

A (simplified) use case I have seen:

<pre>
  std::string StringFromVector(std::vector&lt;char&gt; const&amp; vc)
  { return std::string(vc.data(), vc.size()); }
</pre>

Since a conforming implementation can return a null pointer for vc.data() when vc.size() == 0.  I don't see any reason to disallow this construct, especially since it takes a Standards expert to see that this is possibly illegal, but not std::string(vc.data(), vc.data() + vc.size()).
</p>

This is likely to go onto the LEWG's plate.

[tiny] simultaneous iteration with new-style for syntax

<p>
The new-style 'for' syntax allows us to dispense with administrative
iterator declarations when iterating over a single seuqence.

The burden and noise remain, however, when iterating over two or more
sequences simultaenously.  We should extend the syntax to allow that.
E.g. one should be able to write:
<pre>
    for (auto&amp; x : v; auto&amp; y : w)
       a = combine(v, w, a);
</pre>

instead of the noisier

<p>
As more variadic functions work their way into my C++ code, I'm getting increasingly annoyed that there isn't a variadic bind.

There is a tiny bit of annoyance on exactly what to use. There seems to me to be 2 sensible choices (other people may have others)

<pre>
  1) _args : Use all otherwise unnamed arguments.
  2) _3onwards : All arguments from the 3rd onwards.
</pre>

I haven't personally found a need for multiple ranges of variadic arguments, or more complicated chopping (such as getting the last few arguments), and I'd want to hopefully keep this simple if possible!

</p>
<p>
This is a proposal to allow specializing templates from within a different namespace. The motivation is that when we declare a new class, it is natural to want to provide associated template specializations. For example, it is really painful that whenever I declare a class, I need to leave my namespace and enter namespace std just to specialize std::less as shown below

<pre>
  namespace A {
    namespace B {
      class C {...};
    }
  }

  namespace std {
    template &lt;&gt;
    struct less&lt;C&gt; : binary_function &lt;C, C, bool&gt; {
       bool operator() (const C &amp; x, const C &amp; y) const {...}
   };
  }

  namespace A {
    namespace B {
      ... // Continue working in A::B
    }
  }
</pre>
 

Instead, I should be able to specialize std::less without having to break out of my namespace:

<pre> 
  namespace A {
    namespace B {
      class C {...};
      template &lt;&gt;
      struct ::std::less&lt;C&gt; : binary_function &lt;C, C, bool&gt; {
        bool operator() (const C &amp; x, const C &amp; y) const {...}
      };
    ... // Continue working in A::B
    }
  }
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Bristol 2013:  Stroustrup expressed concern about unqualified name lookup in the specializations, and Voutilainen thought that that just might be the reason why the current rules don't allow it. Gottschling voiced concern about the implementation impact, and Voutilainen suggested asking for a quick review of the overall idea from Spicer. Austern thought that this could be palatable if it's expressed as a set of rewrite rules. Spertus asked about an alternative which is to be able to open another namespace without having to exit the current namespace. This alternative didn't gain success.

Spertus to write a paper. 
</p>
<p>
In Chicago 2013, EWG guidance was to work based on the current proposal N3730 without the facility of specializing a namespace-scoped template from inside a class.

Bristol 2013: Van Winkel pointed out that this allows jumping out of nested 
loops. Naumann expressed doubt over whether the problem is so big that we 
need such a big extension to solve it. Van Winkel and Spertus thought that 
this would likely be a popular feature. Voutilainen thought that it would be 
beneficial to revisit a lambda solution. Talbot expressed doubt whether that's 
a suitable solution, syntax-wise and performance-wise. Austern thought that 
this seems to be in flux, and thought we aren't necessarily ready to choose 
between the various options. Gottschling thought Vandevoorde's option is 
nice, since it's still structured. Spertus said he likes the idea of having 
a control structure be an expression. Austern recommended looking closely 
at Clause 5 in the follow-up paper.

Core pointed out problems in Bristol. Gregor summarized in Chicago 2013 that
The primary template might not be the right place to pick constructors from. (Partial) specializations might have completely different constructors. 
Stroustrup thought that there's only two ways: all specializations have to be 
in scope, and you look at all of those, or look only at the primary and give 
an error if that doesn't work.  Spertus is encouraged to write a follow-up

<p>
In 20.4.1p2, the unspecialized std::tuple_size is undefined.  It would be a lot more useful if it were defined as an empty struct; that way, it can be used with enable_if for determining whether or not it is valid to use tuple_size, tuple_element and get on the corresponding data structure.

using namespace std;
int main() {
 const string{ "Hello" };                   // 1: error
 "xyzzy" + const string{"Hello"};           // 2: error

 42ul + unsigned_long{0};                   // 8: ok

}
</pre>
Sutter says:
<p>
The issue is "lines 1 to 8 below should all work." That they don't is just because of the reason Nikolay pointed out using line 1 below as an example:
<p>
> The error is purely syntactic: 'const string' is not a simple-type-specifier
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
Richard Smith points out the following:
<p>
I can't comment on what was noticed in the abstract, but I was certainly aware of all the above cases. And the rules make sense to me: function-style casts are supposed to be function-style, and the above error cases doesn't look like a function call (and not just because you've put the paren next to the type in the function-call-like cases, and added an extra space in the other cases!).
<p>
I'm not sure exactly what rules you're proposing, but I hope we don't make this valid:
</p>
<pre>
  struct A { int n; }; // ok, struct definition
  struct A { 0 }; // might now be an expression?
</pre>
</p>
</p>
<p>
Regarding using a parenthesized type as a work-around, Sutter explained:
<p>
I think it needs to be an open EWG issue after all, because as Johannes pointed out the workaround doesn't work because it can't call multi-argument constructors, such as that
<pre>
    (const vector&lt;int>)( 1, 2  )
</pre>
drops the 1 on the floor and creates a vector containing two zeroes.
And that it doesn't work for list initializations, such as that
<pre>
    (unsigned int){ 1, 2, 3, 4 }   // C compound literal(?!)
</pre>
doesn't work.
</p>
</p>
<p>

According to Wong, this paper was reviewed on the last day in EWG in Chicago
2013, although with no recorder. The summary was that many people liked the 1st solution (AliasGrouping), and authors are encouraged to develop it further.

<p>
Discussed in Chicago 2013: Return object that overloads -> to point to 
subobject. Wrapper that points into itself. Boost "iterator facade" that 
uses curiously recursive template pattern that does this. It's a pain. 
What other motivating use cases demonstrate this is a general problem? 
Has to be a relation to operator. that we've tried to invent a few times. 
Extra integer looks odd, more so than hack for operator++. We're not yet 
convinced problem is general enough to require a language change. Not 
opposed to change, but feels like it's tail end of bigger problem. 
Didn't quite like the syntax.

Discussed in Chicago 2013: 

<p>    Poll 4: Conservative approach. SF 3 - 2 - 5 - 0 - 0 SA </p>
<p>    Poll 5: Aggressive approach: SF 6 - 1 - 3 - 0 - 0 SA </p>
<p>    Poll 6: Support both, with different attributes. SF 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 0 SA </p>

<p>
Vandevoorde expressed that he likes the idea of having two attributes,
one for memoizing and the other for non-side-effecting. Stroustrup and
Spertus expressed concern about multiple attributes being confusing.
Stroustrup gave his guidance to have a two-part proposal with both
the "aggressive" mode and the more conservative mode. Vandevoorde
promised his assistance for writing the wording.

</p>
<p>
Reviewed in Chicago 2013. Stroustrup recommended looking into Vandevoorde's 
solution of doing a type manipulation instead of running code in a conversion 
since there doesn't seem to a palatable reason for running code, and thought 
that the solution should be simplified, and it should be much better than 
what you can hack today. The author is encouraged to pursue the idea further.
